                    <p>Rewind me at when I was preparing my Bayesian Statistics exam. During my Master's.</p>
<p>Well, at that time I was really into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCoNh78UC4E">this kind of shit</a>. Believe it or not, it seemed to me that I was onto something. Long story short: since at that time I felt I really need to get as much as possible from that course, I started to set 5 minutes timers every day while <strong>I was repeating myself</strong> &ldquo;<em>I'm gonna get the top score with this, I'm gonna get the top score with this, I'm gonna get the top score with this</em>&quot;. Silly as fuck innit? It's not really what a man of science would do to make things happen.</p>
<p><img src="/img/ladder.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a man with two scientific degree now let me tell you something: I know what you think. I really do. When you are not that familiar with non-fiction stuff those <strong>pumped up titles</strong> might be really misleading. They might let you think you are about to read some useless shit that has been written to sell and that's why you have that book in your hand. Cause it was so good at selling but at the same time so <strong>bad at helping</strong>. Consider also that if the book we're talking about is telling you that you can really get rich by transforming an idea into something, <strong>without considering any of the other factors</strong> involved, but purely with <strong>desire</strong>, let me put my degrees in a hidden corner and let me tell you that even a fucking red fish knows that's pure bullshit.</p>
<p>This book was written in the 30s. Guys, in the <strong>fucking</strong> 30s. If you're picturing it like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBAl9cchQac">this kind of economical and self growth shit</a>, you would probably be disappointed if I tell you instead that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B7-Vcdlld8">this</a> was my actual feeling during the experience of reading it. I felt like something was happening in my head. It really gave me the impression that my neural connections were being rewired into their correct plugs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/think_grow_rich.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is happening because the books is narrating true stories of people that turned an idea into an obsession, and with the right tools happen to achieve <strong>unbelievable things</strong>. Creating a billionaire company, gather a million dollar in less than a week, you know the kind of things that happen after you read a book. And while from the black corner my two degrees are screaming for letting me reasoning, on the other hand I started to feel <strong>something going on in my head</strong>. It is fucking crazy if you think that something like that can really be possible. But if you're familiar with my review, you know I always leave the hot stuff in the end.</p>
<p>I took back my degrees from the corner. I look at my master's. It some kind of printout on a fake parchment thing with something written on it. It says I got the <strong>full score</strong>, not that I did it to <strong>impress ladies at parties</strong> (Can you imagine meeting a hot chick and be like &ldquo;<em>Hey, would you like to hang out with a real epidemiology deal &lsquo;n have a blast?</em>&quot;). But it does bring me back to that silly time when I used to set timers telling myself that I was going to get the full score at that damned exam. When I was trying to make it into an obsession, to fired up my desired about it.</p>
<p>And guess <strong>how</strong> that ended up.</p>
