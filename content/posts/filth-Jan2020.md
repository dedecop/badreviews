My ears are not a toilet, but it seems Mr Irvine Welsh doesn't really care.
<!--more-->

I should probably suggest this to my parents, so that maybe they'd stop complaining about my swearing for good. But then they would have something bigger to complain about, like their little angel handing them this book. I gotta admit, I was not ready for this. 

To be really honest, when you hear something about Irvine Welsh is feels like some kind of humongous mythology god is being summoned (not a guy like [this](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/591239.Fabio_Volo)), though I don't think this is appropriate, and this book is one of the reason why. This is the shocking story of how a **polis** guy called Bruce Robertson live and fill his days. He is a liar, a thief, and a sexually addict that is literally trying to have sex with anything that moves on a daily basis. While reading this, for clear reasons [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reHGIYHAR2Q) crazy song pop into my mind. This Bruce guy, he swear, he is a junkie, and he constantly stabs every person he meets in the back. Regardless of who is it: family? colleagues? so-called-friend? stranger? He screws with all of them. And even though pretty early I started to hate this guy, I think it was kind of the whole point. So you know, I was cool with it.

One of the main problem with this book is that **it's so fucking long** . But for loving book like [this](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo), the problem wasn't really his length. Instead, the flaw here is that the plot is not really justifying how long is this thing. Plus, maybe **I'm not really a Yale guy** , but for the love of God, it was so fucking hard to follow. 

The last 15% of the book seems to be explaining many things that would have been useful to know a little earlier, but eventually the whole point of the book is revealed, somehow.  I'm a bit numb to be honest, **not really knowing what to think** . Cause I'm really disappointed, but maybe in the late 90s people got crazy about this kind of shit. I don't really know. Got to admit though, that he got the guts to put **some crazy shit on paper** writing this.

Though I realy love grotesque and cynic books, I have to admit I haven't neither liked nor enjoyed reading this. And I feel a bit bad about letting down a myth like this (**Spoiler alert** , I haven't really like 1984 either, which is probably worse). Considering all of this, we still do have a silver lining here (also because you know, I already read this so I better found one or admit I wasted my time). \
Jokes aside, reading the miserable life of this **Steve piece-of-shit Robertson**, despite all he does (remember, he is a police guy) what really hit me was that this son of a bitch feels really good about himself. So the next time I feel like shit because I said the wrong thing at work, I'll try to remember this guy here.

So if anything, it'll make you feel like a better person, that's for sure.
