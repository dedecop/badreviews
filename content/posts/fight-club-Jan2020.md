I really need a break from this monotony, for this reason I gotta ask you something. 
Yeah, you, who are reading this.

I need you to hit me as hard as you can. Don’t worry, I’m ready to take it. The real question is: **are you?**

Don’t frown at me, I’m not insane or something. I just need to be shaken. I need to shred all I have built. My 9-18 job, my mortgage, my **fucking** big screen. My income that lets me pay my place that let me watch my **fucking** big screen using a **fucking** streaming service membership.

When I first saw Fight Club I was like 16 and I entered a different dimension. Anyone felt like that. If you’re looking for someone who didn’t like it, good luck with that. If you find one, he’s lying. Fight Club is a anti-hero manifesto, a hymn against self improvment, is the dancing singing **shit of the world**. It’s not going out from your comfort zone, it’s more like breaking it into a million pieces. Destroy what you care the most. Shred your linkage to physical possessions, let your house explode using gas. When you’re a teenager and hate everything and everyone, watching Fight Club starts a spark within you. The kind of spark that put your house on fire. \
When you’re going to high school and you’re only concerned about understanding **trigonometry** and get notice by the blonde nice girl you like, Fight Club put everything under a silly light. Everything looks so stupid and hollow. You’re worried about getting that expensive hoodie to impress your cool classmate that you don’t like and that doesn’t give a shit about you, and everything just disappeared. I don’t want to be like that, you repeat yourself. I don’t want to buy shit I don’t need to impress people I don’t like. I won’t become my job. You think, you shout it out loud and eventually you really **believe it**. Plus, if Brad Pitt is feeding you this shit, I don’t know about you guys, but I’m buyin’ it.

The first time I read Fight Club, I was a little older than that. I think I got my bachelor’s already and I had seen the movie many times. I knew its ending very well. I haven’t got a job yet, but I started to understand what was coming. I really did. I wasn’t impressed too much, I gotta say it. Cool – I thought – but not really something. At that time I thought it was the fact of watching the movie earlier than the book, which in my opinion was so good (guys, it’s a ’99 movie). But still I haven’t really made up my mind yet. I loved the message it wanted to send the audience.
Then one day I stumbled upon some kind of geek/self-help website that got me. One of its post was titled something like **“Harsh truth that will make you a better person”** and at some point it brought up Fight Club. 
It refers to the famous leitmotiv  that Tyler uses to shake the main character. \
You are not your job.\
You are not the money you make.\
The website was claiming that Tyler was being ironic in those lines.\
**What?**

Let’s just try not to jump to conclusion here, cause my adulthood is based on some **solid arguments** and I don’t want to change 'em, like whatsoever.\
You are not your **job**.\
But he’s leading a criminal organization that wants to put the whole world on fire and mayhem.\
You are not the **money** you make. \
But he’s running a successful business by selling soap for a buttload of money.\
You are not the **clothes** you wear.\
Though those who are working for you have to wear some black shit cause you know, black is so good with anything.

And while I’m payin’ the bills using my home banking account during the weekend, I finally get it. Maybe Palahniuk didn’t mean to put some irony on Tyler Durden’s word, but here I am. Crunching numbers for my expenses, caring about my employee job day after day.\
You are not your job.\
Cause you know, at the end of the day **a motherfucker got bills to pay**. And I’m cool with that. And while I look myself in the mirror, I want to make sure my shoes match my suit cause I’m visiting a client today.\
You are not the clothes you wear.\
You are the dancing singing shit of the world.

And then I realize that maybe Tyler was really being sarcastic.
