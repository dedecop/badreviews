How japanese see death is something westerns would never grasp.

It must be some kind of cultural split. Which is the same thing I though when severals years ago read [Norwegian Wood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=HxH5RIZWlZ&rank=1) that I haven't really liked. I'm pretty cool with drama, but maybe that was a bit too much.

This is a cute book, some sort of modern fairytale with a catch. It tells how the world would be not if **cat would disappeared** as you might realize from its title, instead how would look like by making disappeare something to get a more day of living. *Great deal, huh?*

Honestly, I do think it's a bad idea, but the thing here is that is being written in such a simple and too much flat way. So much that I'm not sure who this was aiming at. The moral, so meaningful and full of pathos, is clearly for >20 aged people. While on the other hand the language of the book made me believe this was for a less-than-16 kid. Unlike [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3082303078?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) (still about **cat 'n' death**) that despite the false promise to be addressed to a child was in fact pretty clear that was instead aiming at adults. Maybe I'm a dumbass and I'm not seeing something, maybe cause the author is doing that on purpose for some kind of oxymoron thing (Maybe like the one I have experienced by reading [this](https://writingbadreviews.com/posts/fango-mar2020/)), but to be honest if I had to put a penny on it, I wouldn't.

Well, a nice message without any doubt, tho such a shame the tone starts to rise once the **80% of it** is over, which in my opinion is a bit too far. Sometimes books came out of a single idea, like this one, but if you are building a book around it then you gotta put more wood on the fire. Too flat, last bit aside.
Also, what's with the totally **misleading** title? Again, maybe this was on purpose and I'm the simpleton here. I would buy it.

Nevertheless, a thing is certain, this is worth a read. A tiny book with some good food for though. What is also certain is that I will never buy their idea of death. Probably, the same way they'd never get why westerns love **putting ketchup and fried onions** on uramakis. About that, to be honest, I'm not sure either.
