title: Going Back in Time is Not a Thing

When I was in 9th grade my math teacher gave us a couple of lessons about paradoxes. 
<!--more-->

The twin paradox, the birthday paradox, and the barber one, who took me like 10 years to make it my own. On the other hand, one that I managed to understand pretty easily, was the grandfather paradox, which tells the physics that going **back** in time is not really a thing (for proving something about going **foward**, we still have time). Suppose you go back  in time where your grandfather was young and strong. Imagine you stumble upon him, wandering in the street and surprise him like nothing before. Not like *Lost Long Familiy*, more like **"Put your hands where I can see them"**. And then you take a picture. A good one. One he's going to remember for all of his life.

Before he really met your grandmother, before he had the chance to give her the first goodnight kiss, before they could choose their first born's name. The picture you took starts to make the other **vanish**, the one you have hanging up in your living room today. They all turn white. Not like holy heaven light, more like white noise. And then you look at your hands and they start to look quite blur. And if you did pay enough attention when the teacher was talking about paradoxes, then you're not surprise that even by turning your palms and back couple of times, they still somewhat resemble the **asian videos you can find in a couple of websites** that I'm not going to mention here.

Then you realize you just killed the one that was supposed to choose your father's name. Before he really met your mother, before his first goodnight kiss to her cheek. You know how this goes. Before he might choose their firstborn name.\
**Which happens to be you**.

If you have ever notice that there are more days where facebook is notifying you about 2 or more people celebrating birthdays together, than those where only one poor guy is having it, then you don't need for explanation about the birthday paradox. And now you are also aware of the deal that involves the grandfather.

This book is about hearing from people and friends, the biography of Buster Rant Casey. Every character has its own point of view about him, which may be some kind of mythological creature, while other might consider him as a fucked up misfit, completely disgusted by his addiction to **getting bitten by all kind of animals**. Spiders, snakes, you name it. And as the bites go by, he got rabies but seems not to be that concerned about it.

Grown up Rant, though before he got 30 (unlike the average italian guy) he saved up enough cash thanks to a tip from a weird stranger so he managed to leave his parent and moves to the city.
\
And to pass the time, to feel alive, instead of  [attending meetings where strangers fight themselves for no reason](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36236124-fight-club?from_search=true&qid=SIZddwGWH7&rank=1), he prefers a demolition derby kind of thing called **Party Crashing**.
This thing is basically a match in the streets where cars are crashing into each other for no reason. Cars usually host 4 players, each one with a specific role. In some cases there might be 5 players in a car, even if you'd feel pretty squeezy in that case though. When a team is missing a player, it wander around in a Cadillac shouting at strangers "Do you got money for fuel?", otherwise it's pointless to pick them up.

Would you ever let a guy join your soccer team if he hasn't the proper shoes? \

Among bites, faded clothes and **piss stains on the backseat**, Rant finds out by chance that combining Party Crashing and rabies he is able to travel in time (Science bitch!), defeating the grandfather paradox and leaving everyone shocked. In a grotesque and disgusting pictures, the genius of the disturbed mind of Palahniuk tells the story of this weirdo that some hates and some idolyze. If you're planning to proceed by reading it, rest assured that it won't make you sleep, but if that would be the case then **you are just boosting the wrong peak**, maybe filtered using a history teacher or some kind of car seller. Those are the worst. But be careful cause it will make you shocked (sort of) and you might easily find it disgusting at some point. It's not for everyone, that's for sure.

At the beginning of the book Rant’s father is on a plane and his seat pal gets quite interested about how disgusting and awful this guy is. You know, like those kind of car accidents that you just **can’t stop looking at**. These two lads start talking about Rant story and his mysterious death during a car accident. This story, his story. At 15 I would hardly imagined that 13 years later I would have liked paradoxes that much, but this is it. If at that time I met my older self, he would have probably given me some heavy shit tips about getting rich, and my present self wouldn’t be writing books review before the dawn. But I think you’re already aware that this is not the case. Maybe my future self would have told me something like “I’m the real father of yours” or he would have taken a picture. An **instant picture** that would make my parents cry. \
Or maybe, but just maybe, I would have replaced my math teacher only to let me understand that bloody barber paradox.

Cause you know, practice makes it perfect.
