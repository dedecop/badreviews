Finally some good italian shit.
<!--more-->

Feels like this is the hero that the italian literature needs, not the one it deserves though. I like Ammaniti cause he **doesn’t promise** you anything. No flowers, no unicorns. When the shit is getting hot, he admits it with no shame. When you crossed the line of disgusting a couple of kilometers back, Ammaniti [is not scared](https://www.goodreads.com/ca/book/show/13130071-io-non-ho-paura) (!) and he keeps moving forward. It is something to be appreciated from him, not everyone does that. It requires bravery, and he doesn’t give a damn about satisfying the reader. He’s not **Nicholas Sparks** (I know, oopsi). What happens in those short stories is so unreal that it feels a bit off the road. Though it is narrated in such a realistic way that makes his works pretty solid and we’re back on track in a sec. I don’t know how he does that.

There was a time when one of my former colleague made me notice a cool thing about Pulp Fiction. With all the shit that is happening in there (which by the way, is a really good movie) there are some passages that are **pure genius** for how close are to the real life. Like at the beginning, when Vincent and Jules go to kill that guy (that "*Does he look like a bitch*" [guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo5jnBJvGUs)) and as soon as they get there they went something like "*Damn, we're pretty early for this*". Now, tell me: what kind of **hitman** would say something like that in a movie? I'll tell you who: no-**fucking**-one. And here's how I think about Ammaniti's stuff. Like a beautiful oxymoron.

Fango is a collection of short grotesque stories, some of them are mild, others are **pedal-to-the-metal** with the hot stuff. One of them, The Last New Year's Eve is a little flower of the italian literature of the last 50 years. Such a shame it fills almost half of the book, giving little space for the others that are trying to keep up with it but fails. Would have been really cool to have more of them.
In the last stories I percieved that the writer was a bit **newbie** cause it felt like he got away with them a bit quicky (still, he was only 30 and was one of his first books) and I found it silly. On the other hand I really like how he put the story of the drug dealer. 
This book, like the movie The Last New Year's Eve based on the first story in this very book, is a must for those who belive that the contemporary italian art can't keep up with the rest of the world. If you believe Dante's era is gone that's probably true, though would be astonished by this jam that leave you a bit like that, like **I don't know**. Do I like it? Do I think is awful? Is it the combination of the two instead? 
Don't really know!

When I showed my ex the [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqTtvgf0BU4) **The Last New Year's Eve** (with a classic top notch italian cast) she told me that was the awful thing she ever watched. Then a couple of weeks later we broke up cause I realized that I **haven't really understand a damn thing** about us so it was for the best. And now it's silly, cause in her mind, in her ignorance, she still thinks that I'd show her a bad product. I feel so sorry for her. As soon as the **breakup** is concerned, life goes like this. Maybe reading something like this very book is good cause you realized could have been worst than this. So read it, realize that **life is not Walt Disney**, but also that the way it is, is just fine. If you don't like it or it's not what you were expecting, then you can get mad at me. I'd be cool.

In the meantime Imma go looking up in the dictionary **what the hell an oxymoron is**.
