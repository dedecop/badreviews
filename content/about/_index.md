Pietro is a lazy guy born and raised in Milan suburbs around the middle of 1992. He works as an IT Consultant using a program called SAP. He is mad about music, trying to listen to many different genres and kinds. If you want to look up what he does listen you can click [here](https://www.last.fm/it/user/dede_dashboard) while you can also browse his public [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/11121920430?si=8YCy-h7WTtKnjMJF-KqaeA) (his most favourite is Sweater Weather).

Pietro happens to be a good books reader too, and the main reason he started this website is actually because his good friend Alessandro suggested him to post his (bad) book reviews online. I think he found a couple on his [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64823832-pietro) page and had a laugh.
